This project provides the possibility to ask random ice breaker question in a first session with students. Questions are chosen in a neutral and very open way, so that every student can provide some comments. 

The aim of the questions is to set the stage for futher teaching activities. 

Questions can be easily added or removed in the questions-en.json file, if you want to clone this repo.
